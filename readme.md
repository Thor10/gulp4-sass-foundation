Simple Setup to Automate HTML and SaSS changes using GULP4 and BrowserSync
If you are looking for a simple template or set up to automate your changes in your HTML or SaSS components feel free to clone this project. It uses GULP4 and BrowserSync to handle the automation.

To Run the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites-template foundation
```
Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```
Finally, run `gulp watch` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.
